# OSC-Ass2

README. The contents of this file will help us grade your assignment. It increases your chance of getting a better mark by letting the grader know more about your submission.

In the file, we would like to see the following:

* Give the names of each of the files in your submission and a brief summary of their contents.

* List any assumptions you made in doing your assignment. It's easier if you tell us, rather than us having to find out the hard way.

* A brief summary of the approach you took to solving the assignment.

* Instructions on how to compile and run your program. Yes, this should be standard, but it wasn't with some of the Assignment #1 submissions.

=====

And... make sure you test your program on the undergraduate lab machines before submitting your assignment!
